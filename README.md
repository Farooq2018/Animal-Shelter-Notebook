# Project Summary
When writing programs, I keep in mind that If I have to update the program in the future. I better write comments and keep the code generic. So, it can be
functional with other programs or simply reusable. CRUD Python module can definitely be used with other projects in the future. At the moment, I don't have anything 
particular in mind. But, I will continue to learn and improve my MongoDB and Python knowledge by working on a similar project soon.
As a Computer Scientist, I thoroughly read the requirements and break down the problem into small pieces. Then work on each small problem one by one and bring them
together in the end.
